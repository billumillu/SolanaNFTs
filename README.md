NFTs have been gaining a lot of popularity and momentum over the past 5 years. This analysis focuses on the Solana NFT marketplace that first emerged during the latter part of the year 2017. 

The project intends to investigate various features like the market capital, sales, and their owners. Also examining the failed NFT projects and the numerous categories of the NFTs available. 

It can evidently be seen that ‘Collectibles’ and ‘Digital Art’ are the most saleable categories of NFTs compared to the rest that only contribute a fraction of the volume. 

The analysis also points out that more than half of the NFT projects that entered the marketplace failed to accelerate.
